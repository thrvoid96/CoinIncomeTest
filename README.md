# CoinIncomeTest

I wasn’t satisfied with my performance during the interview, so I decided to recreate this on my own time.
The total coding time was 1 hour and 36 minutes (measured after GitHub and UI setup). I’ll explain the details below.

Explanation:

- Used MVC for the coin management (should have mentioned this during the interview, but it was going to take a long time)
- Save/Load using json
- Used async/await funcions on button listens (This is what took me time. I have not done it before,
  but I know it is a different approach to just listening an event. This is particularly useful when the ui is sort of a
  pop-up and the game logic stops while awaiting the response from player.)
- Added actions/helpers/interfaces/assembly definitions/custom delete save button (in GameManagers > GameInstaller)


I believe this better represents my skills than my interview performance.
I tend to work well under pressure, but being put on the spot in a live content-creation scenario made it harder to focus.

Thank you for your time.
